Summary
Python | Objective-C | C++ developer with automation

Experience
macOS python developer automation (fully remote)
Interai
Oct 2020 – Nov 2022 (2 yrs 2 mos)

The main driver for automation was Chromium.
Two aspects:

1. Code review / code quality wise, similar with the Chromium project guidelines
2. Working with Chromium

1. I have used many of the Chromium project guidelines in our guidelines at Interai in order to have a high quality, optimized, tested, easy to read, fast, correct code base.

2. The main driver of the project I worked on was automating the Chromium process on macOS and control it from outside the process via Inter Process Communication (XPC on macOS). I wrote an Objective-C library from scratch that would be loaded by the Chromium project, and that library would be controlled from outside the process via python and another library I wrote in Objective-C and Objective-C++ for XPC communication.

macOS developer
Bitdefender
Jun 2017 – Jun 2021 (4 yrs 1 mo)

Objective-C and C++ macOS developer
I was involved in Python testing and programming in Objective-C, Objective-C++, and C++. 
The project was intricate, containing numerous linked libraries and tools. 
We subsequently refactored and restructured these to foster a more interactive, plug-and-play developer environment. 
We adhered to Agile methodologies in our workflow. 
To provide a comprehensive overview of the design, I employed UML diagrams and generated source code documentation. 
I was instrumental in smoothing out communication between teams responsible for providing libraries and our integration team.

In addition to the primary responsibilities, I also took part in iOS and Android side projects. 
Gained exposure to Linux and Unix systems, as well as integrating with the Atlassian suite including Bamboo, Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket. 
I contributed to the construction of the CI/CD pipeline for mobile and macOS applications.

Developer
Luxoft
Nov 2014 – 2016 (2 yrs)

macOS - SIP phone - Avaya One-X Communicator for mac
Objective-C with C++ libraries

I contributed to the development of Avaya One-X Communicator for Mac, a communication application akin to Skype, featuring chat and screen-sharing functionalities for macOS. Along with my team, I designed, tested, and architected the remote desktop solution, employing Agile methodologies throughout our process. We initially used Maven for version control before transitioning to Git. The development was conducted in Objective-C, Objective-C++, and C++, while Linux tools were used for maintaining the CI/CD environment. 


During my two-year tenure on this project, the team size varied between four and eight members. My role was multifaceted, encompassing tasks such as development, testing, documentation, and architectural design. I also served as the acting team lead for a compact team of three developers. A crucial part of my responsibilities involved ensuring the product requirements aligned with the client expectations.
Essentially, I served a dual role as both a developer and a DevOps engineer.

Software Developer
Zece si Fiii
2014 – Nov 2014 (less than a year)
Objective-c with Cocoa Touch & Android (JAVA)

As the sole developer for both iOS and Android platforms, I mentored the team on leveraging Git for source control and guided them through manual UX/UI testing. The team structure comprised of myself and a colleague responsible for developing the server, which provided services consumed by the apps I constructed. Primarily, I worked on applications such as radios and nautical navigation apps tailored for cruise ships.
